### Resistors in Series
The basic idea of a “series” connection is that components are connected end-to-end in a line to form a single path for electrons to flow.

### Resistors in Parallel
 The basic idea of a “parallel” connection, on the other hand, is that all components are connected across each other's leads.

### Resistivity of Metal Conductors

Electrical resistivity  is a fundamental property of a material that measures how strongly it resists electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho). The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter (Ω⋅m).
