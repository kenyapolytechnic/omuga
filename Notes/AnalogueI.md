## 1. Atomic Theory of Matter

### 1.1 Atomic Structure
1. The Atom
![Atom](images/atom.png)

***An atom is the most fundamental unit of a solid***. It is composed of 3 fundamental sub-atomic particles:
1. electron, having a charge of **1.6 * 10<sup>-19</sup> Coulomb**
2. protons, which are positively charged
3. neutrons, which are neutral

Protons and neutrons are located in a small nucleus at the center of the atom.

Electrons revolve in around the nucleus in fixed circular as well as elliptical orbits called energy levels.


 If a piece of solid element like copper or zinc is ground into very tiny pieces, the smallest part of it which can take part in a chemical reaction is called an atom.

 #### Atomic Number
 The atomic number (Z) of an atom is equal to the number of protons or electrons contained in the atom. 
 Z = 14 for Silicon
 Z = 32 for Germanium


2. Rutherford's atomic model

The classic model of an atom was given by Ernest Rutherford called the Rutherford atomic model or Rutherford model of the atom/planetary model. However, it is not considered the accurate representation of an atom anymore. 

Rutherford model states that an atom is composed of a central core where nearly the whole mass of the atom is concentrated, and light weight particles move around this central core.


The orbits have no definite paths.

4. Bohr's atomic model



#### Differences Between Rutherford and Bohr's models
Rutherford model does not explain the energy levels in an atom whereas Bohr model explains the energy levels in an atom.
