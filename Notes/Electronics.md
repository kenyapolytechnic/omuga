## 1. Semi Conductor Theory

All materials are composed of very small particles called atoms. They (the atoms) are the building bricks of matter. An atom consists of:

1. A central nucleus of positive charge, around which
2. Small negative particles called electrons revolved in different paths/orbits.


The Nucleus consists of:

1. Protons  
2. Neutrons

#### 1. Atom
![Atom](images/atom.png)

***An atom is the smallest particle of an element***, which can take part in a chemical reaction. If a piece of solid element like copper or zinc is ground into very tiny pieces, the smallest part of it which can take part in a chemical reaction is called an atom.

#### 2. Molecule
A molecule of a compound or element is the smallest particle of a compound or element which is capable of independent existence. A molecule may be composed of atoms of the same element or atoms of different elements.

#### 3. Ion
An ion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms. It is formed as a result of the loss or gain of electrons. The electrons lost or gained are equal to the valence of the ions.

#### 4. Nucleus
The central positively charged particle of an atom consisting of positively charges neutrons and negatively charged neutrons.

#### 5. Neutrons
A neutron is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of every atom except that of simple hydrogen. 

#### 6. Protons
A proton is a positively charged subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom.

#### 7. Electrons
A negatively charged subatomic particle that moves around the nucleus in an a
orbit.

#### 8. Orbit
A path followed by an electron as it moves around the nucleus of an atom

#### 9. Element

***An element is a pure substance consisting only of atoms that all have the same numbers of protons in their nuclei.*** Unlike chemical compounds, chemical elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances by any chemical reaction. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as its atomic number (represented by the symbol Z) â€“ all atoms with the same atomic number are atoms of the same element

#### 10. Compound
A *chemical* compound is any substance composed of identical molecules consisting of atoms of two or more chemical elements.

### Practice
#### 1. Identification of Terminals of A P-N Junction Diode
It is easy to determine the polarity of many wired diodes. The "bar" on the circuit symbol corresponds to the cathode of the diode and this is often marked by a white line around the circumference of the actual diode.

***Notes:***
When a diode is forward biased, it should have a voltage drop of 0.5 - 0.7 Volts, otherwise the diode is damaged.

#### 2. Connection of a Diode in a Circuit
For a current to flow across the PN diode junction it must be forward biased. Under these conditions conventional current flows from the anode to the cathode, but not the other way around.

When a PN junction diode is forward biased, the anode is positive with respect to the cathode, and conversely, when reverse biased the cathode is positive with respect to the anode.
