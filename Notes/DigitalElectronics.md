# Digital Electronics

The term *digital* represents a the method of representing numerical values, by counting digits. Digital systems are contrasted with analog systems. *Analogue systems* are those which have a continuously variable physical quantity such as spatial position, voltage, while digital systems are those which have data or signals expressed as series of the digits 0 and 1.

| Digital | Analogue     | 
|---------|--------------|
|Continuous signals| Discrete Signals |


## 1. Number Systems
A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. Different Number systems are needed because computers use different number systems at different stages of processing data: (1) Entry is done by the user in Decimal, (2) Storage and transmission is done in binary (3) Output can be in Decimal or Hexadecimal, etc

There are 4 commonly used number systems:
| # | Number System | Base     | 
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Binary | Base 2 |
| 1 | Octal | Base 8 |
| 1 | Decimal | Base 10 |
| 1 | Hexadecimal | Base 16 |


### Place Value
Place value is the value of each digit in a number. It depends on the base

It is the position of the number *
| #\Position | 1 | 2     |  n |
|---|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Binary | Ones = 2<sup>0</sup> | Twos = 2<sup>1</sup> | ns = 2<sup>n</sup> |
| Octal | Ones = 8<sup>0</sup> | Eights = 8<sup>1</sup> | ns = 8<sup>n</sup> |
| Decimal | Ones = 10<sup>0</sup> | Tens = 10<sup>1</sup> |ns = 10<sup>n</sup> |
| Hex | Ones = 16<sup>0</sup> | Sixteens = 16<sup>1</sup> |ns = 16<sup>n</sup> |

Therefore:

**Place Value = Base<sup>i</sup>**

Where:

***i is the index of the position of the digit from the left of a whole number***

For Fractions, we have:
| #\Position | 1 | 2     |  n |
|---|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Binary |  2<sup>-1</sup> | 2<sup>-2</sup> | 2<sup>-n</sup> |
| Octal |  8<sup>-1</sup> | 8<sup>-2</sup> |  8<sup>-n</sup> |
| Decimal | 10<sup>-1</sup> | 10<sup>-2</sup> |10<sup>-n</sup> |
| Hex | 16<sup>-1</sup> | 16<sup>-2</sup> |16<sup>-n</sup> |
